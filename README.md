# Critical Role Moments

A website to provide a convenient place to find all of the best moments from Critical Role with embedded videos

## Contributing

Yes please. We need contributors in three key areas:

* Moments! Of course we need to know about your favourite moments. Check out the format required in `data/moments.csv` and issues and/or pull requests to add in your favourite moments are more than welcome.
* Web design. I mean, I know the design is basically perfect, but I'm sure another pair of eyes wouldn't go amiss ;-)
* Ideas for features. The plan was for this to be fairly minimal in featureset, but if there's something you desperately want then please do raise an issue.

## About

After episodes 85/86, I found there were scenes that I just kept going back to because I found them so amazing. I felt like there must be more of those scenes and I wanted to raise them from being buried in the YouTube comments to somewhere more accessible.

I felt like this was a pretty easy project, and I am an experienced JS developer, but I realised I hadn't ever actually tried to produce a single-page web app in *pure* JavaScript, so I decided this was a good time to try it. I think it will be the only time I try it, however...

Cheers!

Peter
